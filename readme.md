# Magpie 
Magpie is a single file, all in one serial comms *inspector* and basic interrogator.
It's purpose is to help you, the embedded engineer, work with the not-embedded-engineer, to help trouble shoot devices that that your customers have access to, but you do not. These not-embedded-engineers, bless their souls, may not be as technically capable as you, so Magpie is intended to help them connect a device to serial comms in a clean and simple way, so you can get some debugging information out of it.

Magpie allows users to:
- Copy and paste the table (gross, but works).
- Email it to you.
- Do a shared video call while you guide them through it.

It's not an earth shattering invention, but will hopefully save you a bit of hassle with troubleshooting end user problems.
